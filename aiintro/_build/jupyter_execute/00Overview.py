# ## Goals of this seminar
# 
# * Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not about creating super-human-science-fiction-creatures. AI, instead provides an **extremely flexible and comprehensive toolbox**, which can be applied for an almost infinite field of applications (See also [Handelsblatt Interview Dr. Steven Peters (Daimler)](https://veranstaltungen.handelsblatt.com/autogipfel/interview-mit-dr-ing-steven-peters-zwischen-realitaet-und-kuenstlicher-intelligenz/)). The main goal of this seminar is to provide you a glimpse into the immense AI potential. In the best case you will find out, that some of your daily work or projects can be better solved by applying AI-tools. 
# * This seminar should provide a structured introduction to AI. **The wide range of AI is subdivided into 4 categories**. For each of these categories the main concepts and application-areas are presented. Knowing the fundamentals of these categories is the **perfect starting point to deepen knowledge in specific subcategories**, e.g. Deeplearning. Moreover it provides the capability to **assign, classify and assess any statement, idea or application on AI** (on a high level).
